# Welcome to K-Mart

## Project Overview

K-Mart, short for Kisan Mart, is an innovative platform designed for Indian farmers to access real-time market prices for their yields. The app shows prices from nearby and distant markets, helping farmers decide where to sell their produce for maximum profit. Beyond market prices, K-Mart offers features like weather updates, event notifications, government schemes, and order management. A future update will include a Crop Doctor feature, using CNN, deep learning, and ML models with TensorFlow, to diagnose plant diseases.

   ```

## Motivation

Indian farmers face challenges in getting accurate and timely information about market prices, which can significantly impact their earnings. K-Mart addresses this by providing a comprehensive platform that not only helps farmers get the best prices for their yields but also offers additional resources to support their farming activities and decision-making processes.

## What It Does

K-Mart allows farmers to:

- **Access Market Prices:** View live prices from various markets to choose the most profitable one.
- **Weather Updates:** Receive timely weather information to plan farming activities.
- **Event Notifications:** Stay informed about relevant agricultural events and deadlines.
- **Government Schemes:** Learn about and apply for government schemes and support programs.
- **Order Management:** Manage and track orders for agricultural inputs and services.
- **Crop Doctor (Future Update):** Diagnose plant diseases by uploading photos of affected plants.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for seamless navigation and ease of use.
- **Real-Time Data:** Access to live market prices and weather updates.
- **Comprehensive Resource Center:** Information on government schemes, events, and order management.
- **Secure and Confidential:** Prioritizes user privacy and data security.
- **Advanced Plant Diagnosis (Future Update):** AI-powered plant disease detection using CNN, deep learning, and ML models.

## How We Built It

K-Mart is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo
- **Backend:** Django, Django Rest Framework, Node.js
- **State Management:** Redux
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Authentication:** JWT Authentication
- **HTTP Requests:** Axios

The backend processes user inputs and maintains the database, while the frontend offers an interactive user interface for accessing market prices, weather updates, and other features.

## Challenges

Integrating the Django-based backend with React Native frontend presented initial challenges, particularly in maintaining real-time data flow and ensuring secure authentication. However, by leveraging Axios for HTTP requests and JWT for authentication, we achieved seamless integration.

## What We Learned

Developing K-Mart provided valuable insights into full-stack development, especially in backend-frontend communication and secure data management. We enhanced our skills in React Native, Django, state management, and machine learning model integration, leading to a robust and user-centric application.

## What's Next for K-Mart

Future enhancements for K-Mart include:

- **Crop Doctor Feature:** Integrating advanced analytics for plant disease detection using CNN, deep learning, and ML models.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Adding new features to further support farmers' decision-making processes.
- **Expanded Resource Center:** Providing more comprehensive information on agricultural practices, government schemes, and market trends.
